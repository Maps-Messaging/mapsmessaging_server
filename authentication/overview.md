# Authentication Library Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the Authentication Library, designed to simplify SSL configurations, authentication, and authorization across various environments. By abstracting the complexities associated with cryptographic standards and authentication mechanisms, this library enables developers to seamlessly integrate secure communication and user management into their applications.

## Key Features

- **Identity Lookup and Management**: Provides a generic api that enables identity management with LDAP, Cognito, Auth0, Unix, Apache htaccess and built in encrypted store. [Configuration Details](/authentication/identity_lookup.md)
- **SSL Configuration and SSLEngine Construction**: Facilitates the setup of SSL/TLS and DTLS networks, ensuring secure communication channels. [Configuration Details](/authentication/ssl_configuration.md)
    - Supports TLS and DTLS networks.
    - Ability to load keystore/truststore from files, Consul Vault, and AWS Secrets.

- **UUID Interface**: Offers support for UUID versions 1, 4, 6, and 7, providing a versatile range of options for unique identifier generation.

- **JAAS Support**: Integrates with multiple authentication providers, including AWS Cognito, Auth0, and SSL Certificate-based identification, among others.
    - Includes Apache .htaccess, Unix passwords, LDAP, JWT, encrypted inbuilt, Auth0, Cognito. [Configuration Details](/authentication/jaas_authentication.md)

- **Password Cipher Support**: Enables the use of various encryption algorithms for password security.
    - Supports bcrypt*, md5, pdkdf2*, sha* algorithms.

- **SASL Support for SCRAM**: Provides client/server support for SCRAM, enhancing the security of authentication mechanisms.

- **User Authorization**: Manages access control based on resource IDs, ensuring that users have the appropriate permissions to access resources.

## Important Note

The cryptographic functionalities are not implemented directly within this library. Instead, it leverages industry-standard libraries to provide a unified interface for accessing these cryptographic and authentication services, simplifying the integration process for developers.
