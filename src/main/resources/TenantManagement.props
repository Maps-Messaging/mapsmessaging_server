#
# This configuration file is keyed on the username, with the value being the resultant namespace used for all
# destinations for the user. This can ensure that users namespaces do not clash.
# If the username can not be found within the configuration, it will fall through to "default", if a default
# entry is found then it will use it.
#
# Supported Tokens are
# {user} == the username being used for the connection
# {protocol} == the protocol being used for the connection
#

#
# Used for all connections, unless explicitly found within the configuration
#
default = /home/{user}
