# Format is [(udp|dtls)|(tcp|ssl)://(remote hostname|remote ip address)/(protocol used)/(username)
# examples:
#   tcp://*/mqtt/*  - All MQTT TCP connection match
#   *://*/*/fred    - The user fred will match regardless of protocols
#   i2c://1/29/*    - will match the I2C device 29 on bus number 1
#
# Order of priority is left to right, so in the above if fred connected via TCP and MQTT it would match the first entry
#
transformations:
  data:
    - pattern: "*://*/*/*"
      transformation: "CloudEvent-Native"
