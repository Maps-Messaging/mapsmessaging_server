#  Name: DestinationManager.yaml
#
#  Description:
#  ------------
#
# This configuration maps a namespace path to a physical directory, this
# enables specific user files to be stored separate directories and allows a
# mechanism to monitor / manage user file space
#
#  Format:
#  -------
#
#  name:       Generic name for the mapping, useful for management identification
#  directory:  Physical path to directory to use for all destinations that
#              map to the namespace
#  namespace:  The start of the namespace path that is used to match for the
#              mapping
#  type:       The type of the backing store, support are File or memory backing
#  sync:       If File backing then enabling sync will flush buffers to the underlying hardware on each write
#              or update of the data structures. This reduces throughput but also reduces the loss of data on
#              system failure. ( System failure here means OS failure or catastrophic hardware failure, not application crash )
#              in most circumstances this can be disabled, unless you really know what you are doing.
#
#  cache:      Configures the caching layer, if enabled, for this name space data stores
#        type: The type of cache to be used, currently only WeakReference or JCS is implemented
#        writeThrough: If enabled the actual write to the file, potentially, done in the future.
#                      This option is only recommended for topics or queues where data loss on
#                      system failure is acceptable
#  Notes:
#  ------
# Substitution is support for the following tokens
#
#  {folder} - will replace the token with the username
#
