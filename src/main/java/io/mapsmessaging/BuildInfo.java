 * This class wraps two public static final String variables: buildDate and buildVersion.
 * The buildDate variable represents the date and time of the build in the format "dd-mmm-yyyy HH:MM:SS".
 * The buildVersion variable represents the version of the build in the format "00.00.00-SNAPSHOT".
 * The class is annotated with @ToString, which generates a toString() method for the class.
 * This allows the class to be printed in a human-readable format.
