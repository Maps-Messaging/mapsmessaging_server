/**
 * The support of JMS over AMQP is contingent on the payload following the specification, found here
 * https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/60574/amqp-bindmap-jms-v1.0-wd09.pdf By using the Proton AMQP Message the classes here provide a mapping between the AMQP
 * (JMS) message and the internal Message.
 *
 * This enables non JMS clients to send and receive events from a JMS client and vice versa
